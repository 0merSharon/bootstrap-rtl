# Bootstrap RTL

> Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.

Bootstrap RTL provides simple yet robust right-to-left capability for Bootstrap 3. Simply add its CSS to the pages designed by Bootstrap 3.

## Quick start

To get started, **[download latest version](https://github.com/morteza/bootstrap-rtl/releases)**. Check `examples/` directory for more. It's just like Bootstrap 3, nothing special. You can also install it via bower:

* Run `bower install bootstrap-rtl` and latest version will be installed under *bower_components/bootstrap-rtl/* directory.

In addition to bootstrap distribution, LESS codes for RTL theme and compiled CSS (`bootstrap-rtl.css`) are provided, as well as minified CSS (`bootstrap-rtl.min.css`). Check `dist/` directory for all the codes you need.

#### Fonts
*Glyphicons* and *Iranian Sans* are included for icons and farsi scripts, respectively.

## Building CSS and JavaScript

Bootstrap RTL uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for working with the framework. Follow these simple steps to prepare and compile:

1. Run `npm install` to download and prepare dependencies.
2. Run `grunt`, and check `dist/` directory for outputs.
